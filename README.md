# FirstCodesInPython
 This repository contains the first codes that I wrote in Python.
 The problems were taken originally from: https://www.ime.usp.br/~macmulti/exercicios/inteiros/index.html .
 The main idea is to solve all these problems, considering the efficiency and efficacy of the code.
 Meanwhile, some aspects of UX will be considered too.
 
# Languages
 All codes will be push in two languages: Portuguese and English.
 You can find the Portuguese version on the branch CodigosEmPortugues.
 You can find the English version on the branch CodesInEnglish.
 
# How you can colaborate?
 You can colaborate by commenting improvements, finding errors and validating what you found interesting.

# Personal and Global Goals
 Pushing these codes here, I aim to learn, improve and practice my knowledge of Python.
 At the same time, I also would like to inspire more people to learn how programming in this incredible language.
